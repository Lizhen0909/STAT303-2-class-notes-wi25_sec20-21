    "text": "1.1.1 Training with statsmodels\nHere, we will use the statsmodels.formula.api module of the statsmodels library. The use of “API” here doesn’t refer to a traditional external web API but rather an interface within the library for users to interact with and perform specific tasks. The statsmodels.formula.api module provides a formulaic interface to the statsmodels library. A formula is a compact way to specify statistical models using a formula language. This module allows users to define statistical models using formulas similar to those used in R.\nSo, in summary, the statsmodels.formula.api module provides a formulaic interface as part of the statsmodels library, allowing users to specify statistical models using a convenient and concise formula syntax.\n\n# Let's create the model\n    \n# ols stands for Ordinary Least Squares - the name of the algorithm that optimizes Linear Regression models\n\n# data input needs the dataframe that has the predictor and the response\n# formula input needs to:\n    # be a string\n    # have the following syntax: \"response~predictor\"\n    \n# Using engineSize to predict price\nols_object = smf.ols(formula = 'price~engineSize', data = train)\n\n\n#Using the fit() function of the 'ols' class to fit the model, i.e., train the model\nmodel = ols_object.fit()\n\n\n#Printing model summary which contains among other things, the model coefficients\nmodel.summary()\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

No.\n7.64\n\n\n\nNotes:[1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.\n\n\nThe model equation is: \\(\\hat{price}\\) = -4122.0357 + 12990 * engineSize\n\nR-squared is 39%. This is the proportion of variance in car price explained by engineSize.\nThe coef of engineSize (\\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\)) is statistically significant (\\(p\\)-value = 0). There is a linear relationship between X and Y.\nThe 95% CI of \\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\) is [1.25e+04, 1.34e+04].\nPI is not shown here.\n\nThe coefficient of engineSize is 1.299e+04. - Unit change in engineSize increases the expected price by \\(\\$\\) 12,990. - An increase of 3 increases the price by \\(\\$\\) (3*1.299e+04) = \\(\\$\\) 38,970.\nThe coefficients can also be returned directly usign the params attribute of the model object returned by the fit() method of the ols class:\n\nmodel.params\n\nIntercept     -4122.035744\nengineSize    12988.281021\ndtype: float64\n\n\nVisualize the regression line\n\nsns.set(font_scale=1.25)\nax = sns.scatterplot(x = train.engineSize, y = train.price,color = 'orange')\nsns.lineplot(x = train.engineSize, y = model.fittedvalues,color = 'blue')\nplt.xlim(-1,7)\nplt.xlabel('Engine size (in litres)')\nplt.ylabel('Car price')\nlegend_elements = [Line2D([0], [0], color='blue', lw=4, label='Predicted (Model)'),\n                   Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', label='Actual',\n                          markerfacecolor='orange', markersize=10)]\nax.legend(handles=legend_elements, loc='upper left');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the above plot can be made directly using the seaborn function regplot(). The function regplot() fits a simple linear regression model with y as the response, and x as the predictor, and then plots the model over a scatteplot of the data.\n\nax = sns.regplot(x = 'engineSize', y = 'price', data = train, color = 'orange',line_kws={\"color\": \"blue\"})\nplt.xlim(-1,7)\nplt.xlabel('Engine size (in litres)')\nplt.ylabel('Car price')\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\nax.legend(handles=legend_elements, loc='upper left');\n#Note that some of the engineSize values are 0. They are incorrect, and should ideally be imputed before developing the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe light shaded region around the blue line in the above plot is the confidence interval.\nPredict the car price for the cars in the test dataset. Datasets to be used: Car_features_test.csv, Car_prices_test.csv\nNow that the model has been trained, let us evaluate it on unseen data. Make sure that the columns names of the predictors are the same in train and test datasets.\n\n# Read the test data\ntestf = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/Car_features_test.csv') # Predictors\ntestp = pd.read_csv('./Datasets/Car_prices_test.csv') # Response\ntest = pd.merge(testf, testp)\n\n\n#Using the predict() function associated with the 'model' object to make predictions of car price on test (unknown) data\npred_price = model.predict(testf)#Note that the predict() function finds the predictor 'engineSize' in the testf dataframe, and plugs its values in the regression equation for prediction.\n\nMake a visualization that compares the predicted car prices with the actual car prices\n\nsns.scatterplot(x = testp.price, y = pred_price, color = 'orange')\n#In case of a perfect prediction, all the points must lie on the line x = y.\nax = sns.lineplot(x = [0,testp.price.max()], y = [0,testp.price.max()],color='blue') #Plotting the line x = y.\nplt.xlabel('Actual price')\nplt.ylabel('Predicted price')\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\nax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\nplt.xticks(rotation=20);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prediction doesn’t look too good. This is because we are just using one predictor - engine size. We can probably improve the model by adding more predictors when we learn multiple linear regression.\nWhat is the RMSE of the predicted car price on unseen data?\n\nnp.sqrt(((testp.price - pred_price)**2).mean())\n\n12995.106451548696\n\n\nThe root mean squared error in predicting car price is around $13k.\nWhat is the residual standard error based on the training data?\n\nnp.sqrt(model.mse_resid)\n\n12810.109175214138\n\n\nThe residual standard error on the training data is close to the RMSE on the test data. This shows that the performance of the model on unknown data is comparable to its performance on known data. This implies that the model is not overfitting, which is good! In case we overfit a model on the training data, its performance on unknown data is likely to be worse than that on the training data.\nFind the confidence and prediction intervals of the predicted car price\n\n#Using the get_prediction() function associated with the 'model' object to get the intervals\nintervals = model.get_prediction(testf)\n\n\n#The function requires specifying alpha (probability of Type 1 error) instead of the confidence level to get the intervals\nintervals.summary_frame(alpha=0.05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nmean_se\nmean_ci_lower\nmean_ci_upper\nobs_ci_lower\nobs_ci_upper\n\n\n\n\n0\n34842.807319\n271.666459\n34310.220826\n35375.393812\n9723.677232\n59961.937406\n\n\n1\n34842.807319\n271.666459\n34310.220826\n35375.393812\n9723.677232\n59961.937406\n\n\n2\n34842.807319\n271.666459\n34310.220826\n35375.393812\n9723.677232\n59961.937406\n\n\n3\n8866.245277\n316.580850\n8245.606701\n9486.883853\n-16254.905974\n33987.396528\n\n\n4\n47831.088340\n468.949360\n46911.740050\n48750.436631\n22700.782946\n72961.393735\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n2667\n47831.088340\n468.949360\n46911.740050\n48750.436631\n22700.782946\n72961.393735\n\n\n2668\n34842.807319\n271.666459\n34310.220826\n35375.393812\n9723.677232\n59961.937406\n\n\n2669\n8866.245277\n316.580850\n8245.606701\n9486.883853\n-16254.905974\n33987.396528\n\n\n2670\n21854.526298\n184.135754\n21493.538727\n22215.513869\n-3261.551421\n46970.604017\n\n\n2671\n21854.526298\n184.135754\n21493.538727\n22215.513869\n-3261.551421\n46970.604017\n\n\n\n\n2672 rows × 6 columns\n\n\n\nShow the regression line predicting car price based on engine size for test data.

We can also use the statsmodels.api module to develop a regression model. The syntax of training a model with the OLS() function in this module is similar to that of sklearn’s LinearRegression() function. However, the order in which the predictors and response are specified is different. The formula-style syntax of the statsmodels.formula.api module is generally preferred. However, depending on the situation, the OLS() syntax of statsmodels.api may be preferred.\nNote that you will manually need to add the predictor (a column of ones) corresponding to the intercept to train the model with this method.\n\n# Create the model as an object\n\n# Train the model - separate the predictor(s) and the response for this!\nX_train = train[['engineSize']]\ny_train = train[['price']]\n\nX_train_with_intercept = np.concatenate((np.ones(X_train.shape[0]).reshape(-1,1), X_train), axis = 1)\n\nmodel = sm.OLS(y_train, X_train_with_intercept).fit()\n    \n# Return the parameters\nprint(model.params) \n\nconst    -4122.035744\nx1       12988.281021\ndtype: float64\n\n\nThe model summary and all other attributes and methods of the model object are the same as that with the object created using the statsmodels.formula.api module.\n\nmodel.summary()\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

This might indicate that there arestrong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.\n\n\nNote that the R-squared has increased as compared to the model in Chapter 2 since we added a predictor.\nThe model equation is:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*year + \\beta_2*engineSize + \\beta_3*(year * engineSize) + \\beta4*mileage + \\beta_5*mpg,\n\\end{equation}\\]or\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*year + (\\beta_2+\\beta_3*year)*engineSize + \\beta4*mileage + \\beta_5*mpg,\n\\end{equation}\\]or\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nprice = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1*year + \\tilde \\beta*engineSize + \\beta4*mileage + \\beta_5*mpg,\n\\end{equation}\\]\nSince \\(\\tilde \\beta\\) is a function of year, the association between engineSize and price is no longer a constant. A change in the value of year will change the association between price and engineSize.\nSubstituting the values of the coefficients:\nprice = 5.606e5 - 275.3833year + (-1.796e6+896.7687year)engineSize -0.1525mileage -84.3417mpg\nThus, for cars launched in the year 2010, the average increase in price for one liter increase in engine size is -1.796e6 + 896.7687 * 2010 \\(\\approx\\) \\$6,500, assuming all the other predictors are constant.

However, for cars with an engine size of 3 litres, the average increase in price for a one year newer model is -275.3833+896.7687 * 3 \\(\\approx\\) \\$2400, assuming all the other predictors are constant.\n\n#Computing the RMSE of the model with the interaction term\npred_price = model.predict(testf)\nnp.sqrt(((testp.price - pred_price)**2).mean())\n\n9423.598872501092\n\n\nNote that the RMSE is lower than that of the model in Chapter 2. This is because the interaction term between engineSize and year is significant and relaxes the assumption of constant association between price and engine size, and between price and year. This added flexibility makes the model better fit the data. Caution: Too much flexibility may lead to overfitting!\nNote that interaction terms corresponding to other variable pairs, and higher order interaction terms (such as those containing 3 or 4 variables) may also be significant and improve the model fit & thereby the prediction accuracy of the model.\n\n\n3.1.2 Including qualitative predictors in the model\nLet us develop a model for predicting price based on engineSize and the qualitative predictor transmission.\n\n#checking the distribution of values of transmission\ntrain.transmission.value_counts()\n\nManual       1948\nAutomatic    1660\nSemi-Auto    1351\nOther           1\nName: transmission, dtype: int64\n\n\nNote that the Other category of the variable transmission contains only a single observation, which is likely to be insufficient to train the model.

Thus, the coefficient of Automatic will be redundant, and the dummy variable corresponding to Automatic transmission is dropped from the model.\nThe level of the categorical variable that is dropped from the model is called the baseline level. Here Automatic transmission is the baseline level. The coefficients of other levels of transmission should be interpreted with respect to the baseline level.\nQ: Interpret the intercept term\nAns: For the hypothetical scenario of a car with zero engine size and Automatic transmission, the estimated mean car price is \\(\\approx\\) \\$3042.\nQ: Interpret the coefficient of transmission[T.Manual]\nAns: The estimated mean price of a car with manual transmission is \\(\\approx\\) \\$6770 less than that of a car with Automatic transmission.\nLet us visualize the developed model.\n\n#Visualizing the developed model\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (9,6)\nsns.set(font_scale = 1.3)\nx = np.linspace(train_updated.engineSize.min(),train_updated.engineSize.max(),100)\nax = sns.lineplot(x = x, y = model.params['engineSize']*x+model.params['Intercept'], color = 'red')\nsns.lineplot(x = x, y = model.params['engineSize']*x+model.params['Intercept']+model.params['transmission[T.Semi-Auto]'], color = 'blue')\nsns.lineplot(x = x, y = model.params['engineSize']*x+model.params['Intercept']+model.params['transmission[T.Manual]'], color = 'green')\nplt.legend(labels=[\"Automatic\",\"Semi-Automatic\", \"Manual\"])\nplt.xlabel('Engine size (in litre)')\nplt.ylabel('Predicted car price')\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter('${x:,.0f}')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the developed model, for a given engine size, the car with a semi-automatic transmission is estimated to be the most expensive on average, while the car with a manual transmission is estimated to be the least expensive on average.\nChanging the baseline level: By default, the baseline level is chosen as the one that comes first if the levels are arranged in alphabetical order.

This represents a potentially serious limitation of the model, since in fact a change in engine size may have a very different association on the price of an automatic car versus a semi-automatic or manual car.\nThis limitation can be addressed by adding an interaction variable, which is the product of engineSize and the dummy variables for semi-automatic and manual transmissions.\n\n#Using the ols function to create an ols object.

However, price on average seems to decrease with mileage, albeit in a non-linear manner.\n\n3.2.1 Quadratic transformation\nSo, we guess that if we model price as a quadratic function of mileage, the model may better fit the points (or the curve may better fit the points).

    "text": "2) Multiple Linear Regression with Variable Transformations (22 points)\nThe infmort.csv file has the infant mortality data of different countries in the world. The mortality column represents the infant mortality rate with “deaths per 1000 infants” as the unit. The income column represents the per capita income in USD. The other columns should be self-explanatory. (This is an old dataset, as can be seen from some country names.)\n\n2a)\nStart your analysis by creating (i) a boxplot of log(mortality) for each region and (ii) a boxplot of income for each region. Note that the region column has the continent names. (3 points)\nNote: You need to use np.log, which is the natural log. This is to better distinguish the mortality values.\n\n\n2b)\nIn the previous part, you should see that Europe has the lowest infant mortality rate on average, but it also has the highest per capita income on average. Our goal is to see if Europe still has the lowest mortality rate if we remove the effect of income. We will try to find an answer for the rest of this question.\nCreate four scatter plots: (i) mortality against income, (ii) log(mortality) against income, (iii) mortality against log(income), and (iv) log(mortality) against log(income). (3 points) Based on the plots, create an appropriate model to predict the mortality rate as a function of per capita income. Print the model summary.

(2 points)\n\n\n2d)\nUse the model developed in the previous part to compute a new adjusted_mortality variable for each observation in the data. (5 points) Adjusted mortality rate is the mortality rate after removing the estimated effect of income. You need to calculate it with the following steps:\n\nMultiply the (transformed) income column with its optimal coefficient. This is the estimated effect of income.\nSubtract the product from the (transformed) response column. This removes the estimated effect of income.\nYou may need to do a inverse transformation to calculate the actual adjusted mortality rate values.\n\nMake a boxplot of log(adjusted_mortality) for each region. (2 points)\n\n\n2e)\nUsing the plots in parts a and d, answer the following questions:\n\nDoes Europe still have the lowest mortality rate on average after removing the effect of income?\nHow did the distribution of values among different continents change after removing the effect of income? How did the comparison of different continents change? Does any non-European country have a lower mortality rate than all the European countries after removing the effect of income?\n\n(5 points)",
