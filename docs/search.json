Submit the HTML file.\nFive points are properly formatting the assignment. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nMust be an HTML file rendered using Quarto (1 point). If you have a Quarto issue, you must mention the issue & quote the error you get when rendering using Quarto in the comments section of Canvas, and submit the ipynb file.\nNo name can be written on the assignment, nor can there be any indicator of the student’s identity—e.g. printouts of the working directory should not be included in the final submission.

    "text": "Data description\nThe data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, where bank clients were called to subscribe for a term deposit.\nThere is one train data - train.csv, which you will use to develop a model. There are two test datasets - test1.csv and test2.csv, which you will use to test your model. Each observation is a phone call and each column is a variable about the client or the phone call. Each dataset has the following attributes about the clients called in the marketing campaign:\n\nage: Age of the client\neducation: Education level of the client\nday: Day of the month the call is made\nmonth: Month of the call\ny: did the client subscribe to a term deposit?\nduration: Call duration, in seconds. This attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y=‘no’). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for inference purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n\n(Source: UCI Data Archive. Please use the given datasets for the assignment, not the raw data from the source. It is just for reference.)",
