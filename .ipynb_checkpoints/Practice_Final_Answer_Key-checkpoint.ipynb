    "   \n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>**Explanation:**</span>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>See the graphics in class presentation on *Chapter3_Outliers_high_leverage_influential_points*. Think of influential points / high leverage points / outliers as a force (proportional to the residual corresponding to the point) pulling a canteliver beam.

    "    \n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>B) **High leverage point**: Observations with high leverage have an unusual value for the predictor (ie. lie outside the domain of most points). High leverage point has the potential to have a large affect on the regression line. It is cause for concern if the least squares line is heavily affected by just a couple of observations, because any problems with these points may invalidate the entire fit.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>C) If you have a **high leverage point that is not influencial**: The variance of the response may increase in the presence of high leverage points, since an unusual set of predictor values may correspond to an unusual response, which may increase the total variation. However, as the point is not inluential, the increase in the unexplained variation *(the squared residual)* will not be proportionate to the increase in total variation. As $R^2$ is one minus the ratio of unexplained variation to total variation, it is likely to increase.</span>\n",

    "<span style='color:Blue'>- It provides a much less biased measure of test MSE compared to using a single test set because we repeatedly fit a model to a dataset that contains n-1 observations.</span>\n",

    "<span style='color:Blue'>The statistical learning method is fit on the $n − 1$ training observations, and a prediction $\\hat{y_1}$ is made for the excluded observation using its value $x_1$.
