In other words, multicollinearity inflates the standard errors of the coefficients for which the variables are collinear. Since $t$-statistic is calculated by dividing the estimated coefficient by its standard error, the $t$-statistics shrinks, and the corresponding $p$-value increases. Therefore, the hypothesis test loses the power to reject the null hypotheses, and thus statistically significant variables appearing insignificant. </span>"

    "    \n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>See the graphics in class presentation on *Chapter3_Outliers_high_leverage_influential_points*. Think of influential points / high leverage points / outliers as a force (proportional to the residual corresponding to the point) pulling a canteliver beam. Depending on the position from where you pull the cantilever beam, you may move it too much or too little.</span>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>A) **Inluential point** (high leverage & outlier): an outlier with the respect to both the predictor and the response. It has a large effect on the regression line.

    "    \n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>B) **High leverage point**: Observations with high leverage have an unusual value for the predictor (ie. lie outside the domain of most points). High leverage point has the potential to have a large affect on the regression line. It is cause for concern if the least squares line is heavily affected by just a couple of observations, because any problems with these points may invalidate the entire fit.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='color:Blue'>C) If you have a **high leverage point that is not influencial**: The variance of the response may increase in the presence of high leverage points, since an unusual set of predictor values may correspond to an unusual response, which may increase the total variation. However, as the point is not inluential, the increase in the unexplained variation *(the squared residual)* will not be proportionate to the increase in total variation. As $R^2$ is one minus the ratio of unexplained variation to total variation, it is likely to increase.</span>\n",

    "<span style='color:Blue'>In logistic regression, the response is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution, where the probability of success is a function of the predictors and its coefficients *(the model parameters)*. With this assumption, one can compute the the joint probability density of the observed data as a function of the model parameters. This creates a set of probability distributions *(based on different values of model parameters)* that could have generated the data. The algorithm finds the values of the model parameters *(the beta coefficients)* such that the probability of observing the data maximizes. This probability is the likelihood, and its logarithm is the log-likelihood. The higher the log-likelihood, the more probable it is to observe the data. Thus, log-likelihood is a way to measure the goodness-of-fit of the model.</span>\n",

ROC-AUC is independent of the threshold probability. Both precision and classification accuracy might decrease if the number of FP among actual negatives increase more than the increase of TP among actual positives by the shift in the threshold.</span> "
