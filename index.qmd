# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are class notes for the course STAT303-2-Sec20&Sec21 in Winter 2025. This is not the course text-book. You are required to read the relevant sections of the book as mentioned on the course website. 

This book serves as the course notes for [Course Name], and it is an evolving resource developed to support the learning objectives of the course. It builds upon the foundational work of the original iteration, authored and maintained by Professor Arvind Krishna. We are deeply grateful for Professor Krishna's contributions, as his work has provided a robust framework and valuable content upon which this version of the book is based.

As the course progresses during this quarter, the notes will be continually updated and refined to reflect the content taught in real time. The modifications aim to enhance the clarity, depth, and relevance of the material to better align with the current teaching objectives and methodologies.

This book is a living document, and we welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from students, instructors, and the broader academic community to help improve its quality and utility.

Thank you for being part of this journey, and we hope this resource serves as a helpful guide throughout the course.
