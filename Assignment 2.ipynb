    "3. Use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) to render the **.ipynb** file as HTML. You will need to open the command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and use the command: `quarto render filename.ipynb --to html`. Submit the HTML file.\n",

    "5. **Five points are properly formatting the assignment**. The breakdown is as follows:\n",
    "    - Must be an HTML file rendered using Quarto **(1 point)**. *If you have a Quarto issue, you must mention the issue & quote the error you get when rendering using Quarto in the comments section of Canvas, and submit the ipynb file.* \n",
    "    - No name can be written on the assignment, nor can there be any indicator of the student’s identity—e.g. printouts of the working directory should not be included in the final submission.  **(1 point)**\n",
    "    - There aren’t excessively long outputs of extraneous information (e.g. no printouts of entire data frames without good reason, there aren’t long printouts of which iteration a loop is on, there aren’t long sections of commented-out code, etc.) **(1 point)**\n",
    "    - Final answers to each question are written in the Markdown cells. **(1 point)**\n",
    "    - There is no piece of unnecessary / redundant code, and no unnecessary / redundant text. **(1 point)**\n",
